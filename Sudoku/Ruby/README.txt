This Sudoku solver was created as a way for me to play with some
concepts I've been thinking about.

At first I wanted to do this in a functional language, eg. Haskell or
Erlang (as a way of learning functional thinking).
But I found it difficult to think about problems without thinking in
terms of objects.

So I chose Ruby as a way to flesh out the problem space.
Primarily because:
 1. Ruby is conceptually similar to the languages I know best (Smalltalk
 and Python)
 2. I'm bored with Python
 3. Smalltalk is my day job, and this is for fun.

Specific concepts that I'm thinking about:
 - Immutability. What would happen if I treated objects as if they
 cannot be modified?
 - Biological systems. What would happen if I thought of my Sudoku
 solver as some sort of life form that eats puzzles for breakfast? What can I learn
 from the amazing design of existing biological systems?

This code can be used under the terms of the GPL version 2.
(I haven't looked at version 3 yet)
